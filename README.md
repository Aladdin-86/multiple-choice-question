# multiple-choice-question
In this code, I again modified my Quiz program from the previous repository. I created a separate class for quiz questions, and I created objects of that class to ask questions and check answers. This code I included multiple cut-and-paste operations from the existing "Quiz" class into the new "MultipleChoiceQuestion" class. Object-oriented programming is designed to avoid cut and paste. 
In this code, however, I am converting from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, and cut-and-paste is a simple strategy for this conversion.
